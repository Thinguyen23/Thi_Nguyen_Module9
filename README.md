In this analysis, we gather precipitation and temperature data in June and December across all stations and years. Then we identify key statistical data on the data gathered using describe().

2. Weather data is limited to temperature and precipitation, would be nice if it include weather description such as cloudy/sunny/rainy/snowy...
3. Although weather is important to surf shop's success. I would recommend further studies on customer preferences, location's traffic or competitors' performance to better understand the market, thus better position the company for investments.
